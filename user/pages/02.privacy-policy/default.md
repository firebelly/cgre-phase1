## How We Use Your Personal Information

We have set out below the purposes for which we use your personal information. RPA is required under EU data protection law to identify a legal basis for using your personal information – we have highlighted these in brackets below:

- To present our Website and its contents to you (to achieve our legitimate interest in making this content available to you in an effective way).

If you do not provide RPA with the personal information required to perform our contract with you or comply with our legal or statutory obligations (highlighted as such in the list above), we may not be able to provide those relevant services to you. If you consent to RPA’s use of your personal information and this consent forms the legal basis of our processing of that personal information, you are entitled to withdraw it at any time – see the “Your Rights With Respect To Your Personal Information” section below for more detail.

## Disclosure of Your Personal Information

We may disclose personal information that we collect or that you provide as described in this Policy:

- To our subsidiaries and affiliates (the “RPA Group”) to provide you with requested services.
- To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.

- To enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.
- If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of RPA, our customers, or others.

## Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Personal Information

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your personal information:

- **Tracking Technologies and Advertising.** You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
- **Offers from RPA.** If you do not wish to have your email address/contact information used by RPA to notify you of upcoming events or for our newsletter or other services, you can opt-out by checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data or by sending us an email stating your request to info@rockpa.org. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may send us a return email asking to be omitted from future email distributions. This opt out does not apply to information provided to RPA as a result of a service engagement or other transactions.

## Your Rights With Respect To Your Personal Information

If our processing of your personal information is subject to EU data protection law, you have a number of rights.  These include, in certain circumstances:

- To ask us not to process your personal information, including where RPA is using it for direct marketing purposes.
- To receive a copy of all your personal information held by RPA, in order to check we are processing it lawfully.
- To ask us to correct any errors in your personal information.
- To ask us to delete your personal information, including when exercising your right to object to processing (see above).
- To ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information.
- To ask us to transfer your personal information to another party.
- To withdraw your consent where you have provided it for RPA’s collection or use of your personal information for a specific purpose.
- You may exercise these rights at any time by contacting RPA using the details in the “Contact Information” section of this Policy.

We may not be able to accommodate a request relating to your personal information in certain circumstances prescribed by law. Please contact us using the details in the “Contact Information” section of this Policy if you would like more information.

## Data Retention

We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we use it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

## EU Website Users:  International Transfers

We share your personal information within the RPA Group. For our clients in Europe, this may involve transferring your personal information outside of the European Economic Area (**“EEA”**).  We ensure your personal information is protected by requiring all of our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal information. We may also share your personal information with contractors, service providers and other third parties supporting our business when needed.  Many of these third parties are based outside of the EEA, so their processing of your personal information will involve a transfer of data outside of the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA, we ensure proper protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

We will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal information an appropriate level of protection when being processed outside Europe.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between Europe and the US.
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the EEA.

## Data Security

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. For example, all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls.  In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.  They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.

## Changes to Our Policy

We may revise and update this Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website and handling of your personal information thereafter.  It is our policy to post any changes we make to our Policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will notify you through a notice on the Website home page. The date the Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page.
